A little website I made for Eliiia's father, done as a css exercize for @Media queries, flex-box usage and color gradients. No Css-framework was used to do this so there might be some responsiveness problems in devices which resolution I didnt account for (Like 4:3 or 5:3 monitors). Website is made using mostly css and html with a little script for handling the out of focus for navbar in Mobile devices and small windows size.
